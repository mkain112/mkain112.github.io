# Learning a new flavor of Markdown
I am pretty sure I have this straight now, but you never know.

## Everything before this post was from my old HTML website
Or collected from old GitHub projects. I think you'll agree this is better. And it was fun to make. 

Check chirpy's cool built in Timeline to get a better sense of when things happened:

## I dont know if this is working!
This is my first attempt at posting something to the new website! Wish me luck!

I'll probably try a *bunch* _of_ **formatting** things to try things out!

## Thoughts
![Desktop View](/assets/Chirpy/noblenumbat.jpg){: .right}
As I build this website I find myself really liking and hating the markdown. Its very finicky. Maybe if I find a good, dedicated editor, rather than Ubuntu's built in "Text Editor" but at the moment I am struggling to do simple things like captions on images that are not just centered (but are floated left or right). And am having trouble implementing custom CSS to fix it.
