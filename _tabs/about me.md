Hello! Thanks for stopping by! I'm Mitch Kain, a Mechanical engineer, recovering Data Scientist, and USMC Vet.

I'm a recent Mechanical Engineering M.S. graduate specializing in Dynamics Systems and Control, with hands-on experience in CAD, product design, SolidWorks, OnShape, MATLAB, and simulation. 

I am an Engineer who can calculate, code, model, prototype, and test. I bring curiosity, grit, and results.

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchell-kain/)

The idea is to have a fun ongoing project website where I can try things out and show everyone what I'm working on, while staying comfortable with Git, and learning new skills while also helping in the job hunt. Nothing fancy, just a static site hosted on GitHub with a Jekyll theme.
